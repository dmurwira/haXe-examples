# About

The main goal is to provide usage examples for haXe api.

The code is kept in the src folder and the final examples are kept in 
the output dir. 

Currently it's in an early stage, but some things are starting to
work. 

Every trace statement in the src folder gets an automatically generated
comment with the trace result in output 
(compare - https://github.com/robertbak/haXe-examples/blob/master/src/examples/api/LambdaExamples.hx
and https://github.com/robertbak/haXe-examples/blob/master/output/examples/api/LambdaExamples.hx )
